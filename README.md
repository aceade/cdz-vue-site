# cdz-vue-site
A practice project to teach myself Vue, based on [a scifi series](https://aceade.wordpress.com/connacht-disaster-zone/) I'm working on. This will provide a static site with various pages, which will be rendered via GitHub Actions.

## Required pages
- Home
- Artwork. Will contain carousels of different categories, as based off [this page](https://aceade.wordpress.com/connacht-disaster-zone/connacht-disaster-zone-artwork/). The images will included as direct links from my main site.
