Channels cut into the rock had diverted the frequent rain of Connemara into running past precisely-planted rows of oats or potato plants on its journey down to Lough Tawnyard. Small tunnels dug into the side led into storage caves, carefully sealed off from the main tunnels by a network of stout hatches and firing ports or simply not being connected in the first place.","The new owners of the terrace had little use for plants of any kind, and had decided to simply let them grow wild. It felt vaguely similar to the home they had left four generations ago and couldn\u2019t reach from this new world.
