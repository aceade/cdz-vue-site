She smiled, revealing more teeth that had once been much more yellow. Finally, she had something to wear that wasn\u2019t bleached or grey nettle-fibres issued from the laundry \u2013 something that was hers. Lowering her hands, she turned towards the younger girl in the room to ask what she thought.","\u201CWhy does the collar hang down your back like that?\u201D Aoife asked, swinging her legs idly as she sat on the table next to the sink. Her left hand briefly lifted to point at Maebh\u2019s left shoulder, before returning to rest on her lap. Maebh shrugged, not having cared enough to ask why a sailor\u2019s outfit had such a striped square collar, and nobody had thought it necessary to explain it.","\u201CI want one too,\u201D the other girl admitted enviously. She glanced down at her own grey jumper and off-white dress. Both were clean and the original tears had been well repaired, but they were so...so plain and impersonal. At least they didn\u2019t clash with her ginger hair.","\u201CMaybe you could sew one on yourself?\u201D Maebh lowered her hands to her side. For the second time in nearly seven months, the other girl\u2019s face lit up with something other than apathy for more than a minute as she tilted her head to one side to consider this.

He\u2019d been lying or sitting on the infirmary bed for nearly two hours \u2013 if the clock on the wall was right \u2013 ever since cleaning his teeth after breakfast. He did not want to be there, and the tongue lashing he\u2019d received when saying so did not help.","He glanced around the room again. Bare white walls, alternating grey and white tiles on the floor, and seven more beds. Locked medicine cabinets and a couple of workbenches lined the far wall, with a sink halfway down the room. The unwanted smell of antiseptic came from a door at the far end of the room \u2013 and he jerked his head away, trying to avoid the word printed on the door. Belatedly, he noticed that there was a compact gramophone on a table down the other end.","\u201CA-are you nervous t-too?\u201D","He turned his head to look at the girl sitting cross-legged on the next bed, her green eyes meeting the yellowed sunglasses he wore in a doomed attempt to avoid being accused of being a demon. Her brown hair had been completely shaved on her left side, with uneven stubble growing back.

After five hours of gardening in a draughty, half-leaking greenhouse, it was good to just be alone for five minutes. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t last, as one of Maebh\u2019s teasing comments about herself and Diarmuid came unbidden to the fore.","\u201CCome on, Shiva.

Its shiny metallic body rose from a rounded, well-polished wooden base, curving up towards a boxy tower on one end and an alcove at the other. An array of brass plates adorned the front of the machine, marking the buttons, rounded glass light housings and an embossed slot in a font that appeared to have been delicately carved from the metal itself. In one corner, a thick black cable snaked around behind towards the wall.","\u201CIs that made of silver?\u201D Aoife asked, pointing at the machine, eliciting a few smiles from the other children in the room as they gathered around it. Her twin brother Ciaran gingerly reached forward to tap at the corner near him, where somebody had intricately carved some larger words and the number 418 in what looked like English. His face and body immediately slumped as he found out that it felt too hard to be silver.","\u201CWhat is it, anyway?\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s the t-tae machine that C-c-connacht Trading gifted us.

Grady briefly exposed more of his fangs as his mouth silently worked, before he picked up a tea-towel and began to wipe the plate that lay on the draining board. For a few minutes, neither spoke as Diarmuid focussed on scrubbing the plates and tried to ignore the sidelong glances the other boy gave him.
