Channels cut into the rock had diverted the frequent rain of Connemara into running past precisely-planted rows of oats or potato plants on its journey down to Lough Tawnyard. Small tunnels dug into the side led into storage caves, carefully sealed off from the main tunnels by a network of stout hatches and firing ports or simply not being connected in the first place.","The new owners of the terrace had little use for plants of any kind, and had decided to simply let them grow wild.
