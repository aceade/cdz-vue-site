He could hear somebody settling themselves into a chair, probably a more comfortable one than the metal monstrosity he sat in, thick leather straps around his arms and legs \u2013 the meaty arms and legs that were covered in ugly green scaly patches. Behind the light, he heard matches being struck, smelled a cigarette or cigar coming to life.","He straightened up and tensed as somebody cleared their throat, before a button clicked. When the man behind the light spoke, it was in an upper-class accent that didn't quite mask the speaker's roots in Malahide. His manner was unhurried."]},{src:"https://aceade.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/spymaster.pdf",title:"In Which The Kingdom of Scandinavia Plans To Troll The British Navy",intro:["The swift, efficient rat-tat-tat on the door broke the Admiral\u2019s concentration, just as the cigarette lighter had come to life. Scowling briefly out one side of his mouth, he held the old bullet case to the top of the pipe and puffed as the tobacco began to smoulder. Even before he could ask who it was, the door swung halfway open to reveal a woman in a severe navy-blue tunic that marked her as a Lieutenant. Icy pale blue eyes peered out of a face that was lined with middle-age, her mouth turned down in a disapproving look.","\u201CSir, Mr Bjornsson has arrived,\u201D she announced in a clipped, efficient tone."]},{src:"https://aceade.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/dropoff.pdf",title:"Submarine Dropoff",intro:["The listening and observation posts west of Ballyconneely had long since been established as part of the quarantine network around Connemara. Approximately a company was garrisoned in a series of blockhouses around the peninsula, connected to the main forts at Ballyconeely and Roundstone by redundant telephone wires. Within ten minutes, a report of a suspicious ship would be filtered through the command station, plotted on the mapping tables and relayed out to the corvettes and destroyer boats on standby or already out on patrol.","In theory, at least. In practice, every single sighting in the last thirty years had turned out to either be one of their own ships, or phantoms due to atmospheric conditions. Only once had an unidentified ship turned out to be something unusual \u2013 a bulk carrier out of New York had got lost in a storm, and been very glad to be steered away from the orc-occupied quarantine zone.","Just a mile off the coast of Connemara, the swell of an otherwise normal patch of sea was subtly broken by a metallic tube that was bent forward into a right-angle. It remained there for some time, unhurriedly rotating to either side. Had any naval vessel been close enough to spot it, it would have been quickly recognised. To their southeast, a recurrent yellow flash marked a distant lighthouse, but there were no other signs of lights along the coastline."]},{src:"https://aceade.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/interception.pdf",title:"Interception of an enciphered message from orc-held territory",intro:["The crackle of static in his ears and the flashing blue light to his left caused Able Seaman Davis to shoot upright from where he had slouched in the wooden chair, his right hand resting idly on the notepad on his workstation. Pressing his left hand to his earphones, he leaned forwards and hurriedly transcribed the short, staccato bleeps and longer creeps in the approved shorthand terminology.","\u201CFound something, Davis?\u201D the Lieutenant asked. He automatically nodded, focussing on converting the shorthand transcription into something more legible. Even as he finished and moved onto translating the dots and dashes into possible letters, something about it started to niggle at the back of his mind. It almost looked as though...","\u201CSir, I don\u2019t think this is English.\u201D He handed the piece of flash paper over to the Lieutenant, who accepted it with a raised eyebrow that turned into a quizzical frown as he perused the message. Davis glanced over at the door into the main passageway, satisfying himself that it was closed. On the wall next to the door was a poster of a shark looming up from the deep, aiming straight for a stream of letters on the surface.
