Pressing his left hand to his earphones, he leaned forwards and hurriedly transcribed the short, staccato bleeps and longer creeps in the approved shorthand terminology.","\u201CFound something, Davis?\u201D the Lieutenant asked. He automatically nodded, focussing on converting the shorthand transcription into something more legible. Even as he finished and moved onto translating the dots and dashes into possible letters, something about it started to niggle at the back of his mind. It almost looked as though...","\u201CSir, I don\u2019t think this is English.\u201D He handed the piece of flash paper over to the Lieutenant, who accepted it with a raised eyebrow that turned into a quizzical frown as he perused the message. Davis glanced over at the door into the main passageway, satisfying himself that it was closed. On the wall next to the door was a poster of a shark looming up from the deep, aiming straight for a stream of letters on the surface. He turned back to his wireless set, listening for any other messages."]},{src:"",title:"Big Head Mode Is Not Conducive To Effective Scouting",intro:["It was just another day west of the settlement known as Claddaghduff. The daystar remained hidden behind overlapping streaks of clouds, the wind that blew off the sea was biting cold, and the waves that lapped at the shore kicked up an awful spray that made the skin raw. The natives were at best indifferent, if not outright hostile. And there was always the chance that reality would randomly decide to invert itself.","Efioa had long since turned his ears down against the older generation\u2019s complaints about the sea in this new world. New to them, not to him. He had been born here, not that the Fomorians seemed to make any distinction, and had learned to pay attention to the sea. Among the things he had paid close attention to over the last week was the \u201Ccursed island\u201D of Cruagh, situated about two dwarven miles out to sea. He could have sworn that he had seen a giant metal shape disappearing behind it to the west."]},{src:"",title:"Infiltration",intro:["Huddled inside the guard tower, the sentry reached for a pack of cigarettes. Another night in this draughty, open-air shithole, not two miles off the coast from the Fomorians. He wasn't paid enough to watch northeast for boats approaching, listening to the wind playing tricks with his ears. He'd already \u2018heard\u2019 footsteps twice in the last hour","The cigarette lit up the interior of the watchtower. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the construction site for that new tower fifty yards away. Bloody expensive pieces of shite...rather than hiring more people (or, heaven forbid, even just paying him enough to actually care), management had decreed that these lightning throwing machines would protect Cruagh Island. This vital island. It was of the highest importance that the Fomorians and the government be kept-","A sound! He whipped his head round, one hand clutching his IKEA repeater carbine, and peered through the gun slit. Nothing showed itself. He sighed, and leaned back in the hard metal chair.

A hemispherical quarztite table that followed the curves of the walls dominated the centre of the room, surrounded by austere matching thrones. The walls themselves had been lavishly decorated with murals of ships on the rolling waves, wagons in convoy or similar scenes of commerce, interspersed with stark white panels into which the large, bold letters \u201CC T C\u201D had been carved. Pale, pulsing blue light spilled from behind the letters.","Five of the fourteen thrones had been filled, two on either side of the central one. The occupant of the central throne glanced unhurriedly around over steepled fingers, his indexes pressed against the waxed black moustache. His eyes focussed on the goateed dwarf to his left, tea-leaf cigarette already in hand.","\u201CMr Jensen, you claim to have uncovered something that requires legal advice and...what was it?\u201D he began, glancing languidly down at a notepad. \u201CAh, may open us to criminal prosecution up above?\u201D He glanced back up. \u201CAnd yet...this is apparently not critical enough to require the full board of directors.

One was a thin, black-haired boy with yellow sunglasses in front of apparently-orange eyes; to the boy\u2019s right was a girl whose defiant green stare was tinged with apprehension. The hair on her left-hand-side was much shorter.","\u201CAh, Miss MacCarthy. Master O\u2019Flaherty. Come in.\u201D","They obeyed reluctantly, shuffling over to the chairs in front of him. O\u2019Flaherty slumped in his chair, adopting a resigned expression and folding his arms defensively across his chest. MacCarthy sat perfectly upright, hands clasped tightly in her lap. Tightly enough that her knuckles had lost whatever colour they originally had.","Magnusson glanced back at his notes again. Diarmuid U\xED Flatharta and Siobh\xE1n Mac Cartha\xED. Both had been handed over to the department just under a month ago by a group of Fomorian smugglers or pirates, without showing any symptoms of Fomoritis. Unfortunately, Thompson\u2019s biopsy report two days ago had confirmed it.
